Turpial-mobile
==============

Mobile version of Turpial, Twitter and Identi.ca client. Light, fast and fully functional.

How to build it on Linux:
-------------------------

- Install ant
- Download the Android SDK from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html if you don't have it yet
- Extract the package somewhere (I placed it in my home directory /home/andrea/android-sdk-linux_x86)
- Set ANDROID_SDK environment variable with the path where your SDK folder is placed
- Run buildall.sh to build the .apk
- Run run.sh to launch Turpial on your device
